This files gives a rough overview about what has changed in each
version since the first public release (0.5.23).  For a more detailed
view check the CHANGES file, but be aware that it might be too
detailed.  I have worked hard to change err fix bugs in each new
versions.

               - 0.8.x version are dedicated to Lefty -

See CHANGES file for recent changes in the beta versions.  Beta
versions are named -alpha, -beta, -gamma, -delta, ... . 

Version 0.8.1 (2003-07-20)
--------------------------

  - NEW: moxtools: added code to enable users with flag Q to use a
         .!jump command similiar to the .jump for bot masters
  - NEW: added three new question files with english questions (+788
         questions)
  - NEW: added option to prevent overruns (expert players entering a
         game at a late state and overrun the others to gain a high
         allstars score).  When enabled, MoxQuizz does not accept new
         players as soon as one player reached a certain threshold in
         point (defaults to 15 points)
  - NEW: added !antispam command to moxtools.  Sends a antispam.txt
         file (if available and enabled) from the intl dir.
  - NEW: public commands for quizmasters (flag P): !nuq, !uq, !listnuq
         for placing users in ignore for userquestsions (for 45 minutes) 
  - NEW: added .!identify to moxtools.tcl to manually force the script
         to identify to a nickserv (flag P)
  - NEW: added another 185 german questions (thanks to "Said Nasser"
         <viper5539@web.de> and his users)
  - NEW: MoxQuizz will purr if it gets patted (sometimes)

  - FIX: dcc "!say !hug FOO" works again

  - CHG: randomization of questions changed: same algorithm, just
         distributed over the time, i.e. randomization is done bit
         by bit whenever a question is asked.  This speeds up all
         operations which caused a read of the database (.!rehash,
         .reload and initial start of the bot)
  - CHG: renamed !saveuserquestions to !qsave
  - CHG: renamed !configload to !load
  - CHG: renamed !configsave to !save
  - CHG: rank_reset deletes rankfile (done at end of game or on .!rankreset)
  - CHG: changed bantime for badwords in moxtools from 5 to 30 minutes



Version 0.8.0 (2002/02/02)
--------------------------

  - SECURITY HOLE FIXED: eval was available to all ppl havon the P
         flag through mxirc_say.  It was exploitable by saying
         .!say !order [ANY TCL COMMAND]

  - NEW: the script is now able to speak several languages.  Added
         english phrases and such. Funstuff is still english only.  As
         a consequence, MoxQuizz now requires eggdrop version 1.6.6
         and TCL 8.1.

         Available messages: english, german, french, greek
         Available question sets: english, german, malaysian, spanish,
         norwegian

         Future version will catch up.

  - NEW: malaysian (3444 questions, thanks to Damanhuri), norwegian
         question sets (566 question, thanks to Julia33 and BriZen) as
         well as 850 new english questions (thanks to Magic2000,
         Julika and Stan) and 570 more german questions (thanks
         Quakenet) and 1048 spanish questions (thanks to ^MaKaM^)

  - NEW: funcmds !steal, !fast !cry (suggestions from ILoveJackDaniels)
  - NEW: !version command to report version and number of questions
         loaded
  - NEW: !reset as shortcut for .!stop .!rankreset .!init will reset a
         game

         unicode support.  Disabled by default, enabled in nounicode
