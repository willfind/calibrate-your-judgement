[general]
MoxQuizz is a quizbot for IRC acting as a game master asking questions
on a quizchannel.  Answers can be given by any user.  The bot looks
for substrings in all spoken sentences.  The game is won at (by
default) 30 points and the winner receives a certain amount of points
for the allstars table which is calculated from the total amount of
points, the winners points and the duration of the won game. (check
http://meta-x.de/moxquizz/README for the formula).  MoxQuizz was
written from scratch and is © by Moxon <moxon@meta-x.de>.
